Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She’s even started to feel like she knows them. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees it—is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.<br /><br />\t\tAnd then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?<br /><br />\t\tCompulsively readable, <i>The Girl on the Train <\/i>is an emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut.<br />",

                "description": "The The Girl On The Train: by Paula Hawkins | Includes Analysis<br /><br />\nA Smarter You In 15 Minutes… What is your time worth?<br /><br />\nIn what has been a massive success for first time thriller writer Paula Hawkins, The Girl on a Train is a novel packed full of suspense. Highly revered by Stephen King himself, the psychological thriller went straight in at number one on the New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2015, not being knocked off for thirteen weeks. Further praise for this book is given by Dreamworks acquiring the film rights to it, and the film adaptation will be ready for release in October this year.&#xa0;<br /><br />\nA first person narrative details the chilling story from the viewpoint of Rachel, Anna and Megan. Rachel finds her life wrought in jealousy, despair and alcohol abuse following the breakdown of her marriage to Tom. After being tormented by learning Tom not only had a mistress, Anna, but has now remarried and had a child with her too, Rachel plunges into alcoholism and loses her job. The pain of not being able to conceive a child with her husband herself drives Rachel to extreme lengths, taking her old route to work on the train so as not to rouse suspicion of losing her job, and also fantasize whilst passing her former married home.&#xa0;<br /><br />\nThe story is wrought with jealousy, despair and follows many chilling twists and turns as each character's story begins to intertwine and Rachel, Anna and Megan become linked to each other, in macabre circumstances. It becomes clear that Rachel's drinking blackouts have clashed with her obsession with Megan, a woman Rachel has taken to watching along with her husband and imagining their perfect life together. When Megan is reported missing on the news, a bloodied Rachel feels she may be involved and the story becomes embroiled in police investigation and darker twists and turns.<br /><br />\nIn turmoil, Rachel begins trying to find out more about Megan's disappearance and in doing so, gives herself a new focus instead of drinking. She becomes close with Megan's husband, Scott in order to try and learn more and in doing so, lies to him to get closer to him. In a horrific discovery, Megan's body is found and also was evidently pregnant. The fog of Rachel's alcohol abuse begins to clear and she recalls seeing Megan entering Tom's car, thus revealing an affair between them to his new wife Anna. Upon being confronted by Anna, Tom confesses the murder to her by the motive of her threatening to speak out about her pregnancy. In a fast paced turn of events, Tom begins attacking Rachel to silence her, but Rachel stands up for herself. She finds her strength and kills Tom with a corkscrew, with Anna helping and creating alibis to create a story of self defence.&#xa0;<br /><br />\nWinning numerous awards, The Girl on The Train has received outstanding recognition since its release last year.<br />\nTaking the number one spot for the UK Hardback Chart for 20 weeks upon its release, this is a real achievement for British author Paula Hawkins.<br />\nThe book has been sold in 34 countries and widely translated due to its popularity.<br />\nThe story accurately written from the viewpoint of an alcoholic is chilling in its delivery and disintergration into dark crimes.<br /><br />\nWritten by Elite Summaries&#xa0;",

                "description": "<b>In this smart, funny, impassioned call to arms, a pop culture critic merges memoir and commentary to explore how our culture shapes ideas about who women are, what they are meant to be, and where they belong.<\/b><br />Who is \"the girl\"? Look to movies, TV shows, magazines, and ads and the message is both clear and not: she is a sexed up sidekick, a princess waiting to be saved, a morally infallible angel with no opinions of her own. She's whatever the hero needs her to be in order to become himself. She's an abstraction, an ideal, a standard, a mercurial phantom.&#xa0;<br /><br />From the moment we’re born, we're told stories about what girls are and they aren’t, what girls want and what they don’t, what girls can be and what they can’t. \"The girl\" looms over us like a toxic cloud, permeating everything and confusing our sense of reality.&#xa0;In <i>You Play the Girl<\/i>, Carina Chocano shows how we metabolize the subtle, fragmented messages embedded in our everyday experience and how our&#xa0;identity is shaped by them. &#xa0;<br /><br />From Bugs Bunny to Playboy Bunnies, from&#xa0;<i>Flashdance&#xa0;<\/i>to<i>&#xa0;Frozen,<\/i>&#xa0;from the progressive ’70s through the backlash ’80s, the glib ’90s, and the pornified&#xa0;aughts—and at stops in between—Chocano blends formative personal stories with insightful and emotionally powerful analysis. She explains how growing up in the shadow of “the girl” taught her to think about herself and the world and what it means to raise a daughter in the face of these contorted reflections. In the tradition of Roxane Gay, Rebecca Solnit, and Susan Sontag,&#xa0;Chocano brilliantly shows that our identities are more fluid than we think, and certainly more complex than anything we see on any kind of screen.",

Would definitely recommend.”<br /><br />Sally, 34, a pretty and fairly conventional office worker, is on her way home when she catches the eye of a stunningly beautiful Japanese girl. The girl smiles and comes to stand behind Sally, offering her mobile phone for inspection. There is a message there, in a delicate, italicized script. Sally reads, “Hi, I’m Hiroko from Japan! Please keep hands on strap!” Sally's heart was racing now... With her arms raised as instructed, Sally is soon breathless and deliciously helpless as she lets this gorgeous, adventurous and assertive girl explore her, starting at the back of her knees, in the middle of a crowded train. Sally bites her lip and tries to keep quiet: for no-one must know the agonizing ecstasy she is beginning to experience…<br />* Even if you are just a bit curious, this hot and naughty story will excite and delight… Surely, commuting was never this much fun!<br /><br />Girl on a Train: No. 1 in the ‘Tempted by her Student’ series (lesbian seduction)<br />“Four stars!”<br />“Enjoyed the way the story flowed her expressive descriptions and writing voice was excellent and the story was a great little teaser as well. :)”<br />“This short story was pretty exciting.

Returning from war after recovering from an injury, Tommy suspects that his fiancée Mary has had a lesbian affair with her friend Charlie. He is well aware of Mary’s seemingly insatiable sexual appetite and her desires no less powerful than his own. He has no idea that Mary and Charlie have been planning to involve him in their sexual games. A chance encounter with a beautiful woman on the train on the way home, and a bizarre dream when he falls asleep on the train, change Tommy’s attitude. Without wanting to risk losing Mary, he is determined to experience everything he had always wanted to do before he went to war, and that includes any and all sexual opportunities. There is little doubt in his mind that he is going to have Charlie, but there is Jenny, the girl on the train, to think about, quite apart from Alice, the ex fiancée of one of his friends.<br />Just to make it all more complicated, Charlie also has her eyes on Alice, and Mary becomes involved with a girl at the factory where she works.<br />It might have been simpler if their sex-drives were not so intense, but their sexual experimentation becomes increasingly varied and extreme.",
